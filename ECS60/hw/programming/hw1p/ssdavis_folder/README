The testhw grading script and the Testing directory are now available for use, and copying.
Copy testhw to one of your own directories.
There is no need to copy the Testing directory.
testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your timetest.cpp, and boarding.cpp.
testhw will place all of the results in results.txt in the directory with the
timetest.cpp and boarding.cpp code in it.
